Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.
The model classifies transactions as legitimate or fraudulent based on transaction features.

* Problem Statement
Credit card fraud causes significant financial losses.
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions.

* Approach
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Train-test split
- Model training using Machine Learning
- Model evaluation

* Tools and Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

** How to Run the Project
1. Install the required libraries
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb

* Result
The machine learning model is able to identify fraudulent transactions with good accuracy.
